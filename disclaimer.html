  <h1>Website Disclaimer</h1>

  <h2>1. No Online Payments or Transactions</h2>
  <p>This is a static website. We do not process any online payments, and no checkout functionality or secure payment gateway is integrated. If you are ever prompted to enter credit card or banking details through this website, please DO NOT comply—it is unauthorized and potentially fraudulent.</p>

  <h2>2. Payment Terms</h2>
  <p>All transactions are completed via Cash on Delivery (COD), Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT), or Pay2Cell (from First National Bank_FNB). For verification and order processing, we may require your full name and a valid ID number. Payment is made either upon delivery—after the buyer physically inspects the product—or upon pickup from a designated collection point.</p>

  <h2>3. Pricing Accuracy and Corrections</h2>
  <p>While we make every effort to ensure product prices and information are accurate, errors may occur. We reserve the right to correct any inaccuracies, update pricing, and cancel or refuse orders based on incorrect listings. We will not be held liable for any discrepancies or losses arising from such errors.</p>

  <h2>4. Product Representation</h2>
  <p>All product descriptions and images on this website are intended to be as accurate and up-to-date as possible. However, due to factors such as lighting, angles, and the pre-owned nature of many items, slight variations in colour, condition, or features may occur.
Please note that some product photos may have been digitally enhanced or edited to improve the overall appearance of the website. These adjustments are made purely for aesthetic purposes and are not intended to mislead. Clients are welcome to request additional images or details to ensure clarity before making any purchase decisions.
We are not liable for any discrepancies between the images displayed and the actual items. By using this website, you acknowledge and accept these conditions of representation.

  <h2>5. No Warranty or Guarantee</h2>
  <p>All products are sold “as-is” unless stated otherwise. We make no guarantees regarding the performance, durability, or lifespan of pre-owned goods. The buyer assumes responsibility for ensuring the product is suitable for their intended use.</p>

  <h2>6. Limited Liability</h2>
  <p>Under no circumstances shall we be held liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, or consequential damages arising from the use of this website, including but not limited to delays, miscommunications, or the misuse of product information.</p>

  <h2>7. Third-Party Misuse</h2>
  <p>We are not responsible for any third-party communications, impersonation, or fraudulent activity using our brand name or website content. Always confirm any communication directly through our official contact methods.</p>

  <h2>8. Privacy & Security</h2>
